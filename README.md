# Arknights Record Wiki

## Project

Arknights Record Wiki is a full-stack application for uploading, reviewing, and displaying video records of Arknights -- a tower defense mobile game.

We focus on collecting records with the fewest people clearing an operation.

This project is enlightened by an online [document](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DQ0ZpT1pkRkt4YW9r), which became heavy and ponderous as the number of records increased.

## Development

This is the frontend of the project.
- ```
  yarn install
  yarn start
  ```
- Your frontend server will run at port 3000

## Demo

The project is deployed on Heroku at https://arkrec.herokuapp.com/

## License

The project is under MIT license
